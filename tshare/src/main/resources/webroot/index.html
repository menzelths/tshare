= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: Examples
:uri-freesoftware: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
:stem:latexmath
This repository contains a collection of sample projects that demonstrate numerous ways to use the Asciidoctor Maven plugin in a Maven project.

== Getting the examples

[latexmath]
++++
\[
x=x^2-x^3
\]
++++

Clone the example repository using git:

 $ git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-examples

Refer to the README file in each individual project to learn how to run it.

 Example catalog

link:asciidoc-to-html-example/README.adoc[asciidoc-to-html-example] (aka "`The Quickstart`")::
Demonstrates how to convert pass:[ \$x=x^2-x^3\$ ]  AsciiDoc to HTML5 using the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

link:docbook-pipeline-docbkx-example/README.adoc[docbook-pipeline-docbkx-example]::
Demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to DocBook and feed it to the DocBook pipeline to generate a PDF using the Asciidoctor and Docbkx Maven plugins.

link:docbook-pipeline-jdocbook-example/README.adoc[docbook-pipeline-jdocbook-example]::
Demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to DocBook and feed it to the DocBook pipeline to generate a PDF using the Asciidoctor and jDocBook Maven plugins.

link:asciidoctor-diagram-example/README.adoc[asciidoctor-diagram-example]::
Demonstrates how to integrate Asciidoctor Diagram with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

link:asciidoc-to-pdf-example/README.adoc[asciidoc-to-pdf-example]::
Demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

link:asciidoc-site-example/README.adoc[asciidoc-site-example]::
Demonstrates how to process AsciiDoc in a Maven site using the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

link:asciidoc-multiple-inputs-example/README.adoc[asciidoc-multiple-inputs-example]::
An example project that demonstrates how to convert multiple input AsciiDoc documents to HTML5 and PDF using the
Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

link:java-extension-example/README.adoc[java-extension-example]::
An example project that  demonstrates how to create an extension for Asciidoctorj (written in Java) and how to use it in an other documentation Maven module.

link:asciidoc-to-revealjs-example/README.adoc[asciidoc-to-revealjs-example]::
Demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to reveal.js using Asciidoctor revealjs with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

== Root pom.xml

The root `pom.xml` (aggregate build) is provided to allow you to run all the example projects at once using a single invocation of Maven.
It also drives the continuous integration (CI) build.
The root `pom.xml` does not contain any shared build configuration so that each of the projects can be used independently.
This makes the examples suitable as independent references and as a starting point for your own project.

=== Usage

Invoke the `compile` goal (configured as the default goal) on this folder (`asciidoctor-maven-example`):

 $ mvn

== On JRuby dependency

Asciidoctor Maven plugin relies on https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[asciidoctor] project to do the actual rendering. This is a Ruby implementation integrated thanks to the http://jruby.org/[JRuby] project, which is a required dependency to run the plugin. The maven plugin provides a default version of the `jruby-complete` artifact to ease its configuration. However, it can be overwritten just adding a custom version in the plugin's dependency section as seen in the following example:
[source,xml,indent=2]
----

---- 

== Updating Asciidoctor Maven plugin version

In case it is required to test a specific version of the plugin (e.g. local SNAPSHOT version), a tool has been included to update the version in all examples.
To change the plugin's version follow the next steps:
